# Variance Risk Analysis

Mini Python project calculating and comparing investment risk using variance.

## What this project does

- Calculates variance using NumPy  
- Calculates variance manually with a custom function  
- Compares risk between two assets  
- Demonstrates how variance reflects investment volatility  

## Concepts used

- Variance  
- Mean calculation  
- for loops  
- NumPy  
- Financial risk comparison  

## Files

- main.py → variance calculation and comparison  

## Example Output

The variance of Asset A returns is ...
The variance of Asset B returns is ...
Asset X is riskier.

## Notes

This project was created as part of Python practice exercises and personal learning.
Custom variance logic was implemented to better understand the underlying mathematics.
