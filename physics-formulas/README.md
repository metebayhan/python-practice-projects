# Physics Formulas in Python

Mini Python project applying basic physics formulas using functions.

## What this project does

- Converts Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice versa  
- Calculates force using mass and acceleration  
- Calculates energy using Einstein's formula  
- Calculates work using force and distance  

## Concepts used

- Functions  
- Parameters and default arguments  
- Returning values  
- Function composition  
- Basic mathematical formulas  

## Formulas

- Force: mass × acceleration  
- Energy: mass × c²  
- Work: force × distance  

## Files

- main.py → physics calculations  

## Notes

This project was created as part of Python practice exercises and personal learning.
Small structure and formatting improvements were added by me.
