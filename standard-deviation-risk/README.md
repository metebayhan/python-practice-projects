# Standard Deviation Risk Analysis

Mini Python project calculating and comparing investment risk using standard deviation.

## What this project does

- Calculates standard deviation using NumPy  
- Calculates standard deviation manually using a custom implementation  
- Compares risk between two assets  
- Displays results as percentages  
- Determines which asset is riskier based on volatility  

## Concepts used

- Standard deviation  
- Variance  
- Mean calculation  
- for loops  
- NumPy  
- Square root (math.sqrt)  
- Financial risk comparison  

## Files

- main.py → standard deviation calculation and risk comparison  

## Example Output

Standard deviation (custom) Asset A: ...  
Standard deviation (custom) Asset B: ...  
Standard deviation (NumPy) Asset A: ...  
Standard deviation (NumPy) Asset B: ...  
Asset X is riskier.

## Notes

This project was created as part of Python practice exercises and personal learning.
Custom variance and standard deviation logic was implemented to better understand the underlying mathematics.
Results are also compared with NumPy for validation.
